There's a big space for technology in my heart, so expect to find very different 
  things here (and I still don't know what and in what order!). 


Mobile, Swift, Python, Java, Chatbots, Blockchain, Machine Learning, IOT are part 
  of my life some of them in work flavour and other just for fun! Yes, I enjoy 
  technology after work! ;)
  
  Expect to find some nostalgia moments too. I grew up with a Commodore 64 so 8 bit 
  computers are part of my childhood!)

  I hope you have fun and I'll be happy to get feedback in order to learn and improve!
