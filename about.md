Hi and welcome to my corner!

My name is Leo and I was born in 0000011110110100 so I've been lucky to enjoy personal computers almost since their inception.

There's a big space for technology in my heart, so expect to find very different things here (and I still don't know what and in what order!). 

Mobile, Swift, Python, Java, Chatbots, Blockchain, Machine Learning, IOT are currently part of my life. Some of them in work flavour and others just for fun! Yes, I enjoy playing with technology after work. That's when I have real fun! ;)

In the last >20 years I've been working in tech related jobs from Systems Engineering to Software Development and even Analysis and Consulting...
  
Expect to find some nostalgia moments here too. My first computer was a Vic-20 and I grew up with a Commodore 64 so 8 bit computers are fundamental part of my childhood!

I hope we'll have fun together and I'll be happy to get your feedback in order to keep on learning and improving!
